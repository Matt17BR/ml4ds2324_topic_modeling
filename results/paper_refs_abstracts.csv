"Russell S, Norvig P",Artificial Intelligence: a modern approach,"From the enraged robots in the 1920 play R.U.R. to the homicidal computer H.A.L. in 2001: A Space Odyssey, science fiction writers have embraced the dark side of artificial intelligence (AI) ever since the concept entered our collective imagination. Sluggish progress in AI research, especially during the “AI winter” of the 1970s and 1980s, made such worries seem far-fetched. But recent breakthroughs in machine learning and vast improvements in computational power have brought a flood of research funding— and fresh concerns about where AI may lead us. One researcher now speaking up is Stuart Russell, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who with Peter Norvig, director of research at Google, wrote the premier AI textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, now in its third edition. Last year, Russell joined the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom as an AI expert focusing on “risks that could lead to human extinction.” Among his chief concerns, which he aired at an April meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, run by the United Nations, is the danger of putting military drones and weaponry under the full control of AI systems. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2015

"Passfield L, Hopker JG",A mine of information: can sports analytics provide wisdom from your data? Int J Sports Physiol Perform,"This paper explores the notion that the availability and analysis of large data sets have the capacity to improve practice and change the nature of science in the sport and exercise setting. The increasing use of data and information technology in sport is giving rise to this change. Web sites hold large data repositories, and the development of wearable technology, mobile phone applications, and related instruments for monitoring physical activity, training, and competition provide large data sets of extensive and detailed measurements. Innovative approaches conceived to more fully exploit these large data sets could provide a basis for more objective evaluation of coaching strategies and new approaches to how science is conducted. An emerging discipline, sports analytics, could help overcome some of the challenges involved in obtaining knowledge and wisdom from these large data sets. Examples of where large data sets have been analyzed, to evaluate the career development of elite cyclists and to characterize and optimize the training load of well-trained runners, are discussed. Careful verification of large data sets is time consuming and imperative before useful conclusions can be drawn. Consequently, it is recommended that prospective studies be preferred over retrospective analyses of data. It is concluded that rigorous analysis of large data sets could enhance our knowledge in the sport and exercise sciences, inform competitive strategies, and allow innovative new research and findings.",International journal of sports physiology and performance,2017
"Rein R, Memmert D",Big data and tactical analysis in elite soccer: future challenges and opportunities for sports science,"Until recently tactical analysis in elite soccer were based on observational data using variables which discard most contextual information. Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first. The present work discusses these issues with respect to tactical analyses in elite soccer and propose a technological stack which aims to introduce big data technologies into elite soccer research. The proposed approach could also serve as a guideline for other sports science domains as increasing data size is becoming a wide-spread phenomenon.",SpringerPlus,2016

"Shortliffe EH, Sepúlveda MJ",Clinical decision support in the era of artificial intelligence,"A fundamental challenge in the field of clinical decision support is to determine what characteristics of systems make them effective in supporting particular types of clinical decisions. However, we lack such a theory of decision support itself and a model to describe clinical decisions and the systems to support them. This article outlines such a framework. We present a two-stream model of information flow within clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs): reasoning about the patient (the clinical stream), and reasoning about the user (the cognitive-behavioral stream). We propose that CDSS ""effectiveness"" be measured not only in terms of a system's impact on clinical care, but also in terms of how (and by whom) the system is used, its effect on work processes, and whether it facilitates appropriate decisions by clinicians and patients. Future research into which factors improve the effectiveness of decision support should not regard CDSSs as a single entity, but should instead differentiate systems based on their attributes, users, and the decision being supported.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2016

"Borresen J, Lambert MI","The quantification of training load, the training response and the effect on performance","Historically, the ability of coaches to prescribe training to achieve optimal athletic performance can be attributed to many years of personal experience. A more modern approach is to adopt scientific methods in the development of optimal training programmes. However, there is not much research in this area, particularly into the quantification of training programmes and their effects on physiological adaptation and subsequent performance. Several methods have been used to quantify training load, including questionnaires, diaries, physiological monitoring and direct observation. More recently, indices of training stress have been proposed, including the training impulse, which uses heart rate measurements and training load, and session rating of perceived exertion measurements, which utilizes subjective perception of effort scores and duration of exercise. Although physiological adaptations to training are well documented, their influence on performance has not been accurately quantified. To date, no single physiological marker has been identified that can measure the fitness and fatigue responses to exercise or accurately predict performance. Models attempting to quantify the relationship between training and performance have been proposed, many of which consider the athlete as a system in which the training load is the input and performance the system output. Although attractive in concept, the accuracy of these theoretical models has proven poor. A possible reason may be the absence of a measure of individuality in each athlete's response to training. Thus, in the future more attention should be directed towards measurements that reflect individual capacity to respond or adapt to exercise training rather than an absolute measure of changes in physiological variables that occur with training.","Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2009

"Novatchkov H, Baca A",Artificial intelligence in sports on the example of weight training,"The overall goal of the present study was to illustrate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in sports on the example of weight training. The research focused in particular on the implementation of pattern recognition methods for the evaluation of performed exercises on training machines. The data acquisition was carried out using way and cable force sensors attached to various weight machines, thereby enabling the measurement of essential displacement and force determinants during training. On the basis of the gathered data, it was consequently possible to deduce other significant characteristics like time periods or movement velocities. These parameters were applied for the development of intelligent methods adapted from conventional machine learning concepts, allowing an automatic assessment of the exercise technique and providing individuals with appropriate feedback. In practice, the implementation of such techniques could be crucial for the investigation of the quality of the execution, the assistance of athletes but also coaches, the training optimization and for prevention purposes. For the current study, the data was based on measurements from 15 rather inexperienced participants, performing 3-5 sets of 10-12 repetitions on a leg press machine. The initially preprocessed data was used for the extraction of significant features, on which supervised modeling methods were applied. Professional trainers were involved in the assessment and classification processes by analyzing the video recorded executions. The so far obtained modeling results showed good performance and prediction outcomes, indicating the feasibility and potency of AI techniques in assessing performances on weight training equipment automatically and providing sportsmen with prompt advice. Key pointsArtificial intelligence is a promising field for sport-related analysis.Implementations integrating pattern recognition techniques enable the automatic evaluation of data measurements.Artificial neural networks applied for the analysis of weight training data show good performance and high classification rates.",Journal of sports science & medicine,2013

Li C,Predict the neural network mathematical model of basketball team scores based on improved BP algorithm,"Deep learning has achieved impressive prediction accuracies in a variety of scientific and industrial domains. However, the nested nonlinear feature of deep learning makes the learning highly nontransparent, i.e., it is still unknown how the learning coordinates a huge number of parameters to achieve decision-making. To explain this hierarchical credit assignment, we propose a mean-field learning model by assuming that an ensemble of subnetworks, rather than a single network, is trained for a classification task. Surprisingly, our model reveals that apart from some deterministic synaptic weights connecting two neurons at neighboring layers, there exists a large number of connections that can be absent, and other connections can allow for a broad distribution of their weight values. Therefore, synaptic connections can be classified into three categories: very important ones, unimportant ones, and those of variability that may partially encode nuisance factors. Therefore, our model learns the credit assignment leading to the decision and predicts an ensemble of sub-networks that can accomplish the same task, thereby providing insights toward understanding the macroscopic behavior of deep learning through the lens of distinct roles of synaptic weights.",Physical review letters,2020

"Kempe M, Grunz A, Memmert D",Detecting tactical patterns in basketball: comparison of merge self-organising maps and dynamic controlled neural networks,"The soaring amount of data, especially spatial-temporal data, recorded in recent years demands for advanced analysis methods. Neural networks derived from self-organizing maps established themselves as a useful tool to analyse static and temporal data. In this study, we applied the merge self-organising map (MSOM) to spatio-temporal data. To do so, we investigated the ability of MSOM's to analyse spatio-temporal data and compared its performance to the common dynamical controlled network (DyCoN) approach to analyse team sport position data. The position data of 10 players were recorded via the Ubisense tracking system during a basketball game. Furthermore, three different pre-selected plays were recorded for classification. Following data preparation, the different nets were trained with the data of the first half. The training success of both networks was evaluated by achieved entropy. The second half of the basketball game was presented to both nets for automatic classification. Both approaches were able to present the trained data extremely well and to detect the pre-selected plays correctly. In conclusion, MSOMs are a useful tool to analyse spatial-temporal data, especially in team sports. By their direct inclusion of different time length of tactical patterns, they open up new opportunities within team sports.",European journal of sport science,2015

"Link D, Hoernig M",Individual ball possession in soccer,"This paper describes models for detecting individual and team ball possession in soccer based on position data. The types of ball possession are classified as Individual Ball Possession (IBC), Individual Ball Action (IBA), Individual Ball Control (IBC), Team Ball Possession (TBP), Team Ball Control (TBC) und Team Playmaking (TPM) according to different starting points and endpoints and the type of ball control involved. The machine learning approach used is able to determine how long the ball spends in the sphere of influence of a player based on the distance between the players and the ball together with their direction of motion, speed and the acceleration of the ball. The degree of ball control exhibited during this phase is classified based on the spatio-temporal configuration of the player controlling the ball, the ball itself and opposing players using a Bayesian network. The evaluation and application of this approach uses data from 60 matches in the German Bundesliga season of 2013/14, including 69,667 IBA intervals. The identification rate was F = .88 for IBA and F = .83 for IBP, and the classification rate for IBC was κ = .67. Match analysis showed the following mean values per match: TBP 56:04 ± 5:12 min, TPM 50:01 ± 7:05 min and TBC 17:49 ± 8:13 min. There were 836 ± 424 IBC intervals per match and their number was significantly reduced by -5.1% from the 1st to 2nd half. The analysis of ball possession at the player level indicates shortest accumulated IBC times for the central forwards (0:49 ± 0:43 min) and the longest for goalkeepers (1:38 ± 0:58 min), central defenders (1:38 ± 1:09 min) and central midfielders (1:27 ± 1:08 min). The results could improve performance analysis in soccer, help to detect match events automatically, and allow discernment of higher value tactical structures, which is based on individual ball possession.",PloS one,2017

"Jelinek HF, Kelarev A, Robinson DJ, et al",Using meta-regression data mining to improve predictions of performance based on heart rate dynamics for Australian football,"Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a serious and well known complication of diabetes. Previous articles circumvented the problem of missing values in CAN data by deleting all records and fields with missing values and applying classifiers trained on different sets of features that were complete. Most of them also added alternative features to compensate for the deleted ones. Here we introduce and investigate a new method for classifying CAN data with missing values. In contrast to all previous papers, our new method does not delete attributes with missing values, does not use classifiers, and does not add features. Instead it is based on regression and meta-regression combined with the Ewing formula for identifying the classes of CAN. This is the first article using the Ewing formula and regression to classify CAN. We carried out extensive experiments to determine the best combination of regression and meta-regression techniques for classifying CAN data with missing values. The best outcomes have been obtained by the additive regression meta-learner based on M5Rules and combined with the Ewing formula. It has achieved the best accuracy of 99.78% for two classes of CAN, and 98.98% for three classes of CAN. These outcomes are substantially better than previous results obtained in the literature by deleting all missing attributes and applying traditional classifiers to different sets of features without regression. Another advantage of our method is that it does not require practitioners to perform more tests collecting additional alternative features.",Computers in biology and medicine,2013
"Robertson S, Back N, Bartlett JD",Explaining match outcome in elite Australian Rules football using team performance indicators,"The relationships between team performance indicators and match outcome have been examined in many team sports, however are limited in Australian Rules football. Using data from the 2013 and 2014 Australian Football League (AFL) regular seasons, this study assessed the ability of commonly reported discrete team performance indicators presented in their relative form (standardised against their opposition for a given match) to explain match outcome (Win/Loss). Logistic regression and decision tree (chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID)) analyses both revealed relative differences between opposing teams for ""kicks"" and ""goal conversion"" as the most influential in explaining match outcome, with two models achieving 88.3% and 89.8% classification accuracies, respectively. Models incorporating a smaller performance indicator set displayed a slightly reduced ability to explain match outcome (81.0% and 81.5% for logistic regression and CHAID, respectively). However, both were fit to 2014 data with reduced error in comparison to the full models. Despite performance similarities across the two analysis approaches, the CHAID model revealed multiple winning performance indicator profiles, thereby increasing its comparative feasibility for use in the field. Coaches and analysts may find these results useful in informing strategy and game plan development in Australian Rules football, with the development of team-specific models recommended in future.",Journal of sports sciences,2016
"Woods CT, Veale J, Fransen J, et al",Classification of playing position in elite junior Australian football using technical skill indicators,"​In team sport, classifying playing position based on a players' expressed skill sets can provide a guide to talent identification by enabling the recognition of performance attributes relative to playing position. Here, elite junior Australian football players were a priori classified into 1 of 4 common playing positions; forward, midfield, defence, and ruck. Three analysis approaches were used to assess the extent to which 12 in-game skill performance indicators could classify playing position. These were a linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest, and a PART decision list. The LDA produced classification accuracy of 56.8%, with class errors ranging from 19.6% (midfielders) to 75.0% (ruck). The random forest model performed at a slightly worse level (51.62%), with class errors ranging from 27.8% (midfielders) to 100% (ruck). The decision list revealed 6 rules capable of classifying playing position at accuracy of 70.1%, with class errors ranging from 14.4% (midfielders) to 100% (ruck). Although the PART decision list produced the greatest relative classification accuracy, the technical skill indicators reported were generally unable to accurately classify players according to their position using the 3 analysis approaches. This player homogeneity may complicate recruitment by constraining talent recruiter's ability to objectively recognise distinctive positional attributes.",Journal of sports sciences,2018
"Leicht AS, Gomez MA, Woods CT",Explaining match outcome during the men ’s basketball tournament at the Olympic Games,"In preparation for the Olympics, there is a limited opportunity for coaches and athletes to interact regularly with team performance indicators providing important guidance to coaches for enhanced match success at the elite level. This study examined the relationship between match outcome and team performance indicators during men's basketball tournaments at the Olympic Games. Twelve team performance indicators were collated from all men's teams and matches during the basketball tournament of the 2004-2016 Olympic Games (n = 156). Linear and non-linear analyses examined the relationship between match outcome and team performance indicator characteristics; namely, binary logistic regression and a conditional interference (CI) classification tree. The most parsimonious logistic regression model retained 'assists', 'defensive rebounds', 'field-goal percentage', 'fouls', 'fouls against', 'steals' and 'turnovers' (delta AIC <0.01; Akaike weight = 0.28) with a classification accuracy of 85.5%. Conversely, four performance indicators were retained with the CI classification tree with an average classification accuracy of 81.4%. However, it was the combination of 'field-goal percentage' and 'defensive rebounds' that provided the greatest probability of winning (93.2%). Match outcome during the men's basketball tournaments at the Olympic Games was identified by a unique combination of performance indicators. Despite the average model accuracy being marginally higher for the logistic regression analysis, the CI classification tree offered a greater practical utility for coaches through its resolution of non-linear phenomena to guide team success.",Journal of sports science & medicine,2017

Team performance indicators were collated from all women's basketball matches during the 2004⁻2016 Olympic Games (<i>n</i> = 156) and analyzed via linear (binary logistic regression) and non-linear (conditional interference (CI) classification tree) statistical techniques. The most parsimonious linear model retained ""defensive rebounds"", ""field-goal percentage"", ""offensive rebounds"", ""fouls"", ""steals"", and ""turnovers"" with a classification accuracy of 85.6%. The CI classification tree retained four performance indicators with a classification accuracy of 86.2%. The combination of ""field-goal percentage"", ""defensive rebounds"", ""steals"", and ""turnovers"" provided the greatest probability of winning (91.1%), while a combination of ""field-goal percentage"", ""steals"", and ""turnovers"" provided the greatest probability of losing (96.7%). Shooting proficiency and defensive actions were identified as key team performance indicators for Olympic female basketball success. The development of key defensive strategies and/or the selection of athletes highly proficient in defensive actions may strengthen Olympic match success. Incorporation of non-linear analyses may provide teams with superior/practical approaches for elite sporting success.","Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2017

Bock JR,Empirical prediction of turnovers in NFL Football,"Turnovers in the National Football League (NFL) occur whenever a team loses possession of the ball due to a fumble, or an interception. Turnovers disrupt momentum of the offensive team, and represent lost opportunities to advance downfield and score. Teams with a positive differential turnover margin in a given game win 70 % of the time. Turnovers are statistically rare events, occurring apparently randomly. These characteristics make them difficult to predict. This investigation advances the hypothesis that turnovers are predictable in NFL football. Machine learning models are developed to learn the concept: At any point within a football game, what is the likelihood that a turnover will be observed on the next play from scrimmage? NFL play-by-play data for 32 teams spanning seven full seasons were used to train the models. Results presented suggest evidence to support the working hypothesis. Under certain conditions, both fumbles and interceptions can be anticipated at low false discovery rates (less than 15 % ). When a turnover is predicted on the impending play from scrimmage, a high degree of confidence is associated with that prediction. The ability to anticipate catastrophic in-game events may lead to their management and control, ultimately improving the performance of individual athletes and their teams. This investigation contributes to the sports science literature by demonstrating the predictability of in-game events often considered to be essentially random in their occurrence. To the author's knowledge, direct prediction of turnovers has not previously appeared in the literature, which has focused on retrospective statistical analyses of turnover margin in football games.","Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2016
"Morgan S, Williams MD, Barnes C",Applying decision tree induction for identification of important attributes in one-versus-one player interactions: a hockey exemplar,"Decision tree induction is a novel approach to exploring attacker-defender interactions in many sports. In this study hockey was chosen as an example to illustrate the potential use of decision tree inductions for the purpose of identifying and communicating characteristics that drive the outcome. Elite female players performed one-versus-one contests (n = 75) over two sessions. Each contest outcome was classified as either a win or loss. Position data were acquired using radio-tracking devices, and movement-based derivatives were calculated for two time epochs (5 to 2.5 seconds, and 2.5 to zero seconds before the outcome occurred). A decision tree model was trained using these attributes from the first session data, which predicted that when the attacker was moving at ≥ 0.5 m · s(-1) faster than the defender during the early epoch, the probability of an attacker's win was 1.00. Conversely, when the speed difference at that time was below this threshold the probability of a loss was 0.78. Secondary attributes included defender speed in the lateral direction during the early epoch, and angle of attack (i.e., angle between the respective velocity vectors of the attacker and defender) during the late epoch. The model was then used to predict outcomes of one-versus-one contests from the second session (accuracy = 0.643; area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 0.712). Moreover, decision trees provide an intuitive framework for relating spatial-temporal concepts to coaches, and the suitability of decision trees for analysing the features of one-versus-one exchanges are discussed.",Journal of sports sciences,2013

Sheng L,Study of application of factors of volleyball game based on data mining,"The anti‑inflammatory effects of aloin, a bioactive ingredient extracted from Aloe vera, have been described previously. The present study aimed to assess these effects and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with different doses of aloin (100, 150 and 200 µg/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Then, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase‑2 expression levels were detected by western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR).The concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the cell culture supernatant were determined by ELISA. Total nitric oxide (NO) assay and reactive oxygen species (ROS) kits were used to detect NO and ROS levels, respectively. Mitogen‑activated protein kinase, nuclear factor κB and Janus kinase‑signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK‑STAT) pathway activation were verified by western blot analysis. Confocal and nucleocytoplasmic separation experiments were used to detect STAT nuclear translocation. It was identified that aloin decreased the level of LPS‑induced iNOS expression, inhibiting the release of interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6, tumour necrosis factor‑α and NO dose‑dependently. Mechanistically, aloin suppressed LPS‑induced JAK1‑STAT1/3 activation and STAT1/3 nuclear translocation. Additionally, LPS‑induced ROS production was inhibited by aloin. Collectively, these data suggest that aloin attenuated LPS‑induced inflammation by inhibiting ROS‑mediated activation of the JAK1‑STAT1/3 signalling pathway, thereby inhibiting the nuclear translocation of STAT1/3 in RAW264.7 cells. The present study provides an experimental basis for the clinical application of aloin in inflammatory‑associated diseases.",International journal of molecular medicine,2018

"Ertelt T, Solomonovs I, Gronwald T",Enhancement of force patterns classification based on Gaussian distributions,"Description of the patterns of ground reaction force is a standard method in areas such as medicine, biomechanics and robotics. The fundamental parameter is the time course of the force, which is classified visually in particular in the field of clinical diagnostics. Here, the knowledge and experience of the diagnostician is relevant for its assessment. For an objective and valid discrimination of the ground reaction force pattern, a generic method, especially in the medical field, is absolutely necessary to describe the qualities of the time-course. The aim of the presented method was to combine the approaches of two existing procedures from the fields of machine learning and the Gauss approximation in order to take advantages of both methods for the classification of ground reaction force patterns. The current limitations of both methods could be eliminated by an overarching method. Twenty-nine male athletes from different sports were examined. Each participant was given the task of performing a one-legged stopping maneuver on a force plate from the maximum possible starting speed. The individual time course of the ground reaction force of each subject was registered and approximated on the basis of eight Gaussian distributions. The descriptive coefficients were then classified using Bayesian regulated neural networks. The different sports served as the distinguishing feature. Although the athletes were all given the same task, all sports referred to a different quality in the time course of ground reaction force. Meanwhile within each sport, the athletes were homogeneous. With an overall prediction (R = 0.938) all subjects/sports were classified correctly with 94.29% accuracy. The combination of the two methods: the mathematical description of the time course of ground reaction forces on the basis of Gaussian distributions and their classification by means of Bayesian regulated neural networks, seems an adequate and promising method to discriminate the ground reaction forces without any loss of information.",Journal of biomechanics,2018
Ge S,Research on the factors of basketball injury in physical teaching based on artificial neural network,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSC) play pivotal roles in both chemoresistance and recurrence of many cancer types, including urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). In addition to intrinsic signaling pathways, extracellular cues from the tumor microenvironment (TME) are indispensable for the maintenance of CSCs. To better understand the mechanisms involved in TME-mediated generation and support of UBC CSCs, we focused on the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in this study. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p in CAFs promoted CAF-to-UBC cell interactions, cancer stemness, and chemoresistance to treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin. Mechanistically, miR-146-5p upregulated SVEP1 in CAFs by enhancing the recruitment of transcriptional factor YY1. Meanwhile, by targeting the 3'UTR of mRNAs of ARID1A and PRKAA2 (also known as AMPKα2) in UBC cells, CAF-secreted miR-146a-5p promoted cancer stemness and chemoresistance. Downregulation of ARID1A resulted in the inhibition of SOCS1 and subsequent STAT3 activation, and downregulated PRKAA2 led to the activation of mTOR signaling. Elevated levels of exosomal miR-146a-5p in the serum of patients with UBC were correlated with both tumor stage and relapse risk. These findings altogether indicate that CAF-derived miR-146a-5p can promote stemness and enhance chemoresistance in UBC. Exosomal miR-146a-5p may be a biomarker of UBC recurrence and a potential therapeutic target.",Cancer research,2023

Existing studies in the literature provide just a preliminary understanding of which factors mostly affect injury risk, while an evaluation of the potential of statistical models in forecasting injuries is still missing. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to injury forecasting in professional soccer that is based on GPS measurements and machine learning. By using GPS tracking technology, we collect data describing the training workload of players in a professional soccer club during a season. We then construct an injury forecaster and show that it is both accurate and interpretable by providing a set of case studies of interest to soccer practitioners. Our approach opens a novel perspective on injury prevention, providing a set of simple and practical rules for evaluating and interpreting the complex relations between injury risk and training performance in professional soccer.",PloS one,2018

"Goswami R, Dufort P, Tartaglia MC, et al",Frontotemporal correlates of impulsivity and machine learning in retired professional athletes with a history of multiple concussions,"The frontotemporal cortical network is associated with behaviours such as impulsivity and aggression. The health of the uncinate fasciculus (UF) that connects the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) may be a crucial determinant of behavioural regulation. Behavioural changes can emerge after repeated concussion and thus we used MRI to examine the UF and connected gray matter as it relates to impulsivity and aggression in retired professional football players who had sustained multiple concussions. Behaviourally, athletes had faster reaction times and an increased error rate on a go/no-go task, and increased aggression and mania compared to controls. MRI revealed that the athletes had (1) cortical thinning of the ATL, (2) negative correlations of OFC thickness with aggression and task errors, indicative of impulsivity, (3) negative correlations of UF axial diffusivity with error rates and aggression, and (4) elevated resting-state functional connectivity between the ATL and OFC. Using machine learning, we found that UF diffusion imaging differentiates athletes from healthy controls with significant classifiers based on UF mean and radial diffusivity showing 79-84 % sensitivity and specificity, and 0.8 areas under the ROC curves. The spatial pattern of classifier weights revealed hot spots at the orbitofrontal and temporal ends of the UF. These data implicate the UF system in the pathological outcomes of repeated concussion as they relate to impulsive behaviour. Furthermore, a support vector machine has potential utility in the general assessment and diagnosis of brain abnormalities following concussion.",Brain structure & function,2016
"Wu LC, Kuo C, Loza J, et al",Detection of American football head impacts using biomechanical features and support vector machine classification,"Accumulation of head impacts may contribute to acute and long-term brain trauma. Wearable sensors can measure impact exposure, yet current sensors do not have validated impact detection methods for accurate exposure monitoring. Here we demonstrate a head impact detection method that can be implemented on a wearable sensor for detecting field football head impacts. Our method incorporates a support vector machine classifier that uses biomechanical features from the time domain and frequency domain, as well as model predictions of head-neck motions. The classifier was trained and validated using instrumented mouthguard data from collegiate football games and practices, with ground truth data labels established from video review. We found that low frequency power spectral density and wavelet transform features (10~30 Hz) were the best performing features. From forward feature selection, fewer than ten features optimized classifier performance, achieving 87.2% sensitivity and 93.2% precision in cross-validation on the collegiate dataset (n = 387), and over 90% sensitivity and precision on an independent youth dataset (n = 32).

The applied methods include variants of the Assistant algorithm for top-down induction of decision trees, and variants of the Bayesian classifier. The available dataset was insufficient for reliable diagnosis of all sport injuries considered by the system. Consequently, expert-defined diagnostic rules were added and used as pre-classifiers or as generators of additional training instances for diagnoses for which only few training examples were available.

According to the results, there is a wide-ranging differential from novice to experienced coaches. First, while experienced coaches tend to focus on tactical development, novice and intermediate coaches seem to privilege the improvement of technical skills. Second, whereas significant differences between novice and intermediate coaches were found, evidence confirmed that they were higher (both in number and weight) when comparing experienced coaches against novice and intermediate. The study provided strong support to justify the necessity to adjust coaches' knowledge to players' biological developmental, and could form the basis of focused interventions in coaching development.",Journal of human kinetics,2011

We investigated 802 individuals (mean age 69.8 ± 5.6 years), residents of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal. Harmol and PA were assessed using the SF-36 and Baecke questionnaires, respectively, and PF by the Senior Fitness Test. The prevalence of overweight was 71.3%, 26.5% for normal weight, and 2.1% for underweight. We verified a small correlation between age and sex with BMI, PA, PF, and medium borderline with HRQoL. After adjusting for covariates (i.e., sex, age, comorbidities), the multivariate regression analysis indicated a 93.1% chance of improvement in HRQoL for low BMI, while PA and PF revealed a chance of increasing HRQoL by 91.8% and 60.0%, respectively. According to the serial mediation pathway, PA and PF partially mediated the association between BMI and HRQoL by 32.3% and 81.5%, respectively. The total variance of the model was 90%. It was concluded that BMI can negatively affect HRQoL.

Bahr R,Why screening tests to predict injury do not work-and probably never will …: a critical review,"This paper addresses if and how a periodic health examination to screen for risk factors for injury can be used to mitigate injury risk. The key question asked is whether it is possible to use screening tests to identify who is at risk for a sports injury-in order to address the deficit through a targeted intervention programme. The paper demonstrates that to validate a screening test to predict and prevent sports injuries, at least 3 steps are needed. First, a strong relationship needs to be demonstrated in prospective studies between a marker from a screening test and injury risk (step 1). Second, the test properties need to be examined in relevant populations, using appropriate statistical tools (step 2). Unfortunately, there is currently no example of a screening test for sports injuries with adequate test properties. Given the nature of potential screening tests (where test performance is usually measured on a continuous scale from low to high), substantial overlap is to be expected between players with high and low risk of injury. Therefore, although there are a number of tests demonstrating a statistically significant association with injury risk, and therefore help the understanding of causative factors, such tests are unlikely to be able to predict injury with sufficient accuracy. The final step needed is to document that an intervention programme targeting athletes identified as being at high risk through a screening programme is more beneficial than the same intervention programme given to all athletes (step 3). To date, there is no intervention study providing support for screening for injury risk.",British journal of sports medicine,2016

"Afonso J, Esteves F, Araújo R, et al",Tactical determinants of setting zone in elite men's volleyball,"The interactions between two opposing teams lead to the emergence of unique game patterns. In volleyball, attack efficacy emerges as the strongest predictor of the final result and thus it becomes of foremost importance to understand which game patterns afford the attaining of higher attack efficacies. These rely on the quality of the setting action. In turn, the serve and the serve reception constrain the setter's actions and the attacker's efficacy. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine predictors of the setting zone in elite-level men's volleyball. Thirty-one matches of the 2007 World Cup were analyzed, in total 5117 rallies. The dependent variable was the setting zone, and the independent variables were the server player, serve type, serve direction, serve depth, reception zone, receiver player and reception type. Multinomial logistic regression was applied, in order to obtain the estimated likelihood of occurrence of the dependent variable, based on the values of the independent variables (p < 0.05). Only the serve direction showed not to be predictive of the setting zone. Concerning the remaining variables, the tennis jump serve, serves from the middle-player, deep serves, reception near the endline or sidelines, reception by the zone 4 attackers when in defensive zone, and low reception all proved to impair the quality of reception, demanding the setter to play more often in the not acceptable setting zone. Results suggest that, at this level, practice of serve-reception should preferably cover the deep tennis jump serve, and attempt to afford the libero more opportunities to receive. By focusing on the variables with the most predictive power, performers may better allocate their attention towards the most pertinent cues at each moment. Knowledge of these interactive models provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the action sequences, affording coaches important information and guidance. Key pointsA set of key variables interact and allow predicting the setting zone, an important variable in determining attack efficacy in high-level men's volleyball.The tennis jump serve, deep serves, receptions near the endline or sidelines, serves from the middle-players, receptions by the zone 4 attackers when in defensive zone, and low reception enhance the utilization of non-ideal setting zones.By focusing on the variables with the most predictive power, performers may better allocate their attention towards the most pertinent cues at each moment.Knowledge of these interactive models provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the action sequences, affording coaches important information and guidance.",Journal of sports science & medicine,2012

"Halouani J, Chtourou H, Gabbett T, et al",Small-sided games in team sports training: a brief review,"Small-sided games (SSGs) incorporating skills, sport-specific movements, at intensities sufficient to promote aerobic adaptations, are being increasingly implemented in professional team sport environments. Small-sided games are often employed by coaches based on the premise that the greatest training benefits occur when training simulates the specific movement patterns and physiological demands of the sport. At present, there is relatively little information regarding how SSG can best be used to improve physical capacities and technical and tactical skills in team sports. It is possible that with some modifications (e.g., number of players, pitch size, coach encouragement, and wrestling), such games may be physiologically beneficial for athletes with relatively high initial aerobic fitness levels. For instance, it has been shown that 3-a-side soccer SSG resulted in higher intensity (i.e., greater overall distance, less jogging and walking, higher heart rate, and more tackling, dribbling, goal attempts, and passes) than 5-a-side SSG. Likewise, when player numbers were kept constant, a larger playing area increased the intensity of the SSG with a smaller playing area having the opposite effect. It has also been demonstrated that energy expenditure was similar between badminton and volleyball courts, but lower than that obtained in a basketball court. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in rugby that wrestling can increase the physical demands of SSG. Consistent coach encouragement can also increase training intensity, although most rule changes have trivial or no effect on exercise intensity. Further research is required to examine the optimal periodization strategies of SSG training for the long-term development of physiological capacity, technical skill, and tactical proficiency, while also minimizing the associated risk of injuries.",Journal of strength and conditioning research,2014

J Strength Cond Res 35(2): 503-511, 2021-We aimed to investigate the contextual factors influencing training load (TL), as determined by session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE-TL), accumulated within a match-to-match microcycle in rugby union players. Session rating of perceived exertion-TL data were collected daily from 35 professional rugby union players from the same team in the English Championship over the course of an in-season period. Players were split by positional groups (backs and forwards) and sRPE-TL data were categorized as: field-based on-feet sRPE-TL (sRPEField-TL), gym-based sRPE-TL (sRPEGym-TL), and the total summation of both (sRPETotal-TL). Three 2-level linear mixed models were built for each dependent variable in each positional group, with magnitude-based inferences applied. Long between-match recovery cycles (≥7 days) resulted in very likely to almost certainly small to moderate increases in sRPE-TL for all modalities and positions (fixed effect [mean range] = 28.5%-42.0%), apart from sRPEField-TL for forwards. For backs, there was a very likely small decrease in sRPEField-TL as the season progressed (-16.7% per trimester). Losing the last league match was associated with very likely and almost certainly small decreases in sRPETotal-TL and sRPEGym-TL for backs (-20.7% and -36.4%, respectively). Losing the last match in any competition resulted in a very likely small increase in sRPEField-TL (21.2%) and a possibly small decrease sRPEGym-TL (-18.5%) for backs-with a likely smaller sRPEGym-TL for forwards (-33.4%). The strength of the upcoming opposition had no effect on sRPE-TL.

"McLaren SJ, Weston M, Smith A, et al",Variability of physical performance and player match loads in professional rugby union,"The aims of this study were to establish sources of variability in match physical performance of professional soccer players and provide a method for monitoring individual between-match changes. Eleven players meeting the final inclusion criteria were monitored through an entire in-season competition phase (<i>n</i> = 240 individual match observations). Ten Hertz global positioning systems were used to measure match total distance (TD), total high-speed running distance (≥ 21 km·h<sup>-1</sup>; HSRD), total accelerations (TAcc) and maximum running velocity (<i>V</i><sub>max</sub>). Between-player, between-position, between-match and within-player variability were determined through linear mixed effects models. These data were then used to establish the practical significance of individual changes using a Minimum Effects Testing framework. All sources of variability were greater for HSRD (13-36%) when compared with all other metrics (<6%). Using combined between-match and within-player variability along with the smallest worthwhile change (0.2 × between-player SD), between-match individual changes of ±∼10-15% in TD, TAcc and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> were established as practically significant. For HSRD, these thresholds were considerably higher (≥60%). In conclusion, the ability for soccer practitioners to identify meaningful changes in match physical performance can aid decision making around player management following competition. Our study provides a method to flag changes beyond the normal match-to-match variability and by a substantial magnitude. This may have implications for recovery but should be combined with other sources of data (internal load and response) and used only as an adjunct to practitioner domain knowledge/experience.",European journal of sport science,2021
