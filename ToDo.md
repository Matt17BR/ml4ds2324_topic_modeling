## Maximum priority:
- ask and answer some research questions (tailored around the results we've got)
- make some more plots or tables to include in a presentation for the project (see figure 2 & 3 from paper)

## If time allows:

- for sports_ai_techniques see if we can extract keywords for new variables from topic_modeling
