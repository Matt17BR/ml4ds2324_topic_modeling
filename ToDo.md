- ask and answer some research questions (tailored around the results we've got)
- check all comments across the notebooks and add them in a consistent way
- in the keywords_search notebook, improve used keywords so that we can get intersections
- for sports_ai_techniques see if we can extract keywords for new variables from topic_modeling
- make some plots or tables to include in a presentation for the project, see figure 2 & 3 from paper
