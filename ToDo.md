## Maximum priority:

- update comments in topic_modeling (they are inaccurate wrt the data shown in the tables)
- ask and answer some research questions (tailored around the results we've got)
- check all comments across the notebooks and add them in a consistent way
- make some more plots or tables to include in a presentation for the project (see figure 2 & 3 from paper)

## If time allows:

- in topic modeling and everywhere keywords are used, remove words with less than or exactly 3 characters 
- in the keywords_search notebook, improve used keywords so that we can get intersections
- for sports_ai_techniques see if we can extract keywords for new variables from topic_modeling
