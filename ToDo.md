- check if we can scrape another db besides pubmed (gscholar/researchgate have no official api)
- perform topic modeling on both title AND abstract at the same time
- add the following variables to the dataset:
    1. an **ai technique** variable according to the AI techniques listed in paper's Table 2
    2. a **sport** variable according to the categories: *basketball*, *soccer*, *volleyball*, *baseball*, *handball*, *australian football*, *ice hockey*, *american football*, *cricket*, *field hockey* and *rugby*
    3. an **ai for predicting injury risk** variable with respect to the various sports
    4. an **ai for predicting sporting performance** variable with respect to the various sports
- check if the computed topics can be useful to define search key terms and identify ai techniques listed in Table 2 (understand if you can use them to compose a message and perform a search activity)
